"
 this is the easiest way I could find to ...

 todo this is dumb
"

" NOTE: This isn't particularly efficient. Too bad!"
" This is a stupid fix, but I don't have time to do a cleaner implementation."
" This is a bad way to implement ..., but it will work for now."
" This seems like a bad idea but it's fine for now"
" This is terrible, but UI has forced my hand."
" FIXME: This doesn't account for children of hierarchy... too bad!"
" ... inherited from earlier code, WTF?"
" Multithreading badness. This will cause a crash later!"
" This code didn't port easily. WTF does it do? (sjb)"

"
 I don't know why, I don't want to know why, I shouldn't
 have to wonder why, but for whatever reason this stupid ... isn't working out correctly unless we do this terribleness
"

" use an EPSILON damnit!!"

"
 This is catastrophically bad, don't do this.
 Someone needs to fix this.
"

" Yes, this (probably) causes a memory leak. Too bad!"
" ... says: this is bad, dumb code, importantly it's bad dumb code that doesn't make any sense here."
" My hope is that this code is so awful I'm never allowed to write UI code again."
" !!! THIS DOESN'T WORK!! WHY? HAS I EVER?"
" This is some lame crap right here."
" This is utterly garabge."

"
 Aaaannnnnnnnddddd ... has no return code.
 Because nobody could *ever* possible attempt to parse bad data.
 It could never possibly happen.
"

"
 FIXME: This is a terrible way of doing this!
 (reason and better way)
"

Xbox:

" IDIOTS!  WHY WASN'T THIS DEFINED TO BE SAME AS ...?"
" TODO - REWRTIE THIS THING"
" miscellaneous sanity checks (are these legit or should we just quietly tolerate such crap?)"

" for god damn ..., I don't have time to remove them here"
" TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD HACK"
" REVIEW: This crap should be in ..."
" God help us if anyone changes ... in ..."
" hopeless..."
" THIS IS HORRIBLE DESIGN!!!!!!! only a quick hack because all the tests reference this structure."
" It's invalid for someone to pass an empty pidl, but some do."
" For now (this is crap)"
" some crap has happened..."

"
 Why the hell isn't this getting picked up?
 We need to consolidate our utils.
"

" TODO: Remedy this; it's crappy design!!!"
" Global optimizer will kill this poor old code"
" Necessary becaues ... is dumb."

"
 No way on God's green earth we should need ...
 (some code)
 *sigh* we need more than ...
"

" not particularly secure, but oh well."

" can fail when (invoked/whatever) from (...). Oh well, cry me a river."
" this won't fool (Snowy/whoever) when (it/whatever) gets smarter, oh well..."
" This is a stupid hack to make up for regression issues... Sign..."

"
 FUTURE: remove all of this crap
 altogether...
"

" why bother even trying?" (was "bother even trying?" but changed)

GTA V:

" This has got to be some of the lamest in the entire game"
" I won't even begin to claim that I know what the hell is going on here."
(use this however: "goober!". is in same file as "double work")
" double work but at the moment i don't give a damn"
" this is pretty messed up .. seriously this is some convoluted crap."
" this is ugly as hell but i dont care."

 it is not death, but dying, which is terrible

 should be fixed, but let's cover this up until then.

 When I wrote this. Only god and I understood what was going on.
 Now... Only god knows. 
"

" I am not sure if we need this... But too scared to remove."

"
 No comments for you!
 It was hard to write, so it should be hard to read!

 somedev2 - d/m/y Temporary my ass.

" I'm sorry."

"
 This code sucks, you know it and I know it.
 Move on and call me an idiot later.
"

" TODO: Fix this.   Fix what?"

"
 Dear future me.
 Please forgive me.
 I can't even begin to express how sorry I am.

" So sue me"
" stop() // Hammertime!"
" drunk, fix later"
" who cares?"

"
 Basically, without saying too much, you're screwed. Royally and totally.

 (some code)

 If you thought you were screwed before, boy have I got news for you!!!

From songs in my playlist:
" My voice can be heard but there's no way to speak."


My own:

" You forget a thousand things every day. How 'bout you make sure this is one of 'em."
" This code is messy and frisky~"
" It's probably fine."
